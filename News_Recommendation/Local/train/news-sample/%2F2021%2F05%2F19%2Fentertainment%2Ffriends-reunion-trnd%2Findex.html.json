And I live in New York City on the Upper East Side.\"Cox, who played Monica, said: \"I always just feel like Monica would be doing something competitively with other mothers and trying to outdo them. Whether it's the bake sale at school or something. I mean, she'd be so annoying. She'd be at the head of the PTA or something.\"Read MoreKudrow believes Phoebe \"is living in Connecticut with Mike and their kids, and she's in charge of the arts program for the school. And just ... the advocate for her kids because they're different like she was.\"Perry's Chandler \"would be a wonderful father.
