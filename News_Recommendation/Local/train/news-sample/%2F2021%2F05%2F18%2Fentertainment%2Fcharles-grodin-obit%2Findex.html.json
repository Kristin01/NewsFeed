He will be missed. I am very very sad to hear of his passing.\"Other memorable roles include \"Dave,\" in which he appeared as the accountant of a man masquerading as the president of the United States, who is asked to help analyze the federal budget; and the \"Beethoven\" movies, broad comedies in which he played the set-upon dad to a scene-stealing Saint Bernard.<img alt=\"Grodin in 2013 in New York City.

Later, Grodin tried hosting a talk show himself on CNBC, and also became an author, writing a number of books, beginning in 1989 with \"It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here: My Journey Through Show Business.\"Grodin explained that he stumbled on his hostile talk-show persona after following Diana Ross on \"The Tonight Show.\" He then continued to hone that act, and hosts -- especially Letterman -- were delighted to play along.On stage, Grodin starred with Ellen Burstyn in the Broadway play \"Same Time, Next Year,\" about a couple carrying on an annual affair. He also directed and wrote plays, and won an Emmy in 1977 as one of the writers on a Paul Simon TV special.Born in Pittsburgh, Grodin studied acting at the University of Miami before moving to New York and studying under the famed acting coach Lee Strasberg.\"Hollywood is an industry the same way General Motors is an industry,\" Grodin said once in an interview. \"And if you've been doing it for as long as I have you know that.\"Grodin's eclectic career included writing a column for the New York Daily News and providing commentaries for the newsmagazine \"60 Minutes II.\" \"A brilliant comedy actor,\" tweeted Albert Brooks. \"I had the wonderful experience of working with him in my first feature 'Real Life' and he was amazing.\"Grodin is survived by his wife, author Elissa Durwood Grodin, their son Nicholas, and his daughter Marion.<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210518174540-charles-grodin-larry-king-interview-05251987-large-169.jpg\">Charles Grodin discusses his career with Larry King (1987)<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210515182047-damon-weaver-2009-obama-interview-large-169.jpg\">Child reporter who interviewed Obama has died at 23<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210508161301-julie-tawny-kitaen-vpx-screengrab-large-169.jpeg\">Actress Tawny Kitaen dies at 59<img alt=\"Britain&amp;#39;s Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in his role as Captain General, Royal Marines, attends a Parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge on the Buckingham Palace Forecourt in central London on August 2, 2017.  \nAfter a lifetime of public service by the side of his wife Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip finally retires on August 2, 2017,at the age of 96.
