The bill, which is likely to be signed by President Joe Biden, would create a new position at the Justice Department to expedite review of potential Covid-19-related hate crimes and incidents reported at the federal, state or local level. It would also direct the departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to work with community-based organizations to issue guidance raising awareness of hate crimes during the pandemic, and would require the US attorney general to issue guidance to work with state and local law enforcement agencies to establish online reporting of them.The lone Republican senator to oppose the measure in April was Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who said at the time that his opposition stemmed from what he called \"big free speech questions.\" Here are the House Republicans who voted against the legislation: Robert Aderholt of AlabamaRick Allen of GeorgiaJodey Arrington of TexasBrian Babin of TexasJim Banks of Indiana Andy Biggs of ArizonaDan Bishop of North CarolinaLaurne Boebert of Colorado Mo Brooks of AlabamaTed Budd of North CarolinaTim Burchett of Tennessee  Kat Cammack of Florida Jerry Carl of Alabama Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina Michael Cloud of TexasAndrew Clyde of GeorgiaTom Cole of OklahomaWarren Davidson of Ohio Byron Donalds of Florida Jeff Duncan of South Carolina Virginia Foxx  of North CarolinaMatt Gaetz of FloridaLouie Gohmert of TexasBob Good of VirginiaLance Gooden of TexasPaul Gosar of ArizonaMark Green of Tennessee Marjorie Taylor Greene of GeorgiaMichael Guest of MississippiAndy Harris of MarylandDiana Harshbarger of Tennessee Kevin Hern of OklahomaYvette Herrell of New MexicoJody Hice of GeorgiaClay Higgins of LouisianaRonny Jackson of TexasMike Johnson of Louisiana  Jim Jordan of OhioTrent Kelly of MississippiDoug LaMalfa of California Barry Loudermilk of GeorgiaNancy Mace of South CarolinaTracey Mann  of KansasThomas Massie of KentuckyTom McClintock of CaliforniaMary Miller of IllinoisAlex Mooney  of West VirginiaBarry Moore of AlabamaRalph Norman of South CarolinaSteven Palazzo of MississippiGary Palmer of AlabamaScott Perry of PennsylvaniaAugust Pfluger of TexasTom Rice of South CarolinaJohn Rose of TennesseeMatt Rosendale of MontanaDavid Rouzer of North CarolinaChip Roy of TexasJohn Rutherford of FloridaGreg Steube of FloridaTom Tiffany of Wisconsin Randy Weber of TexasCNN's Clare Foran contributed to this report. <img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210504222243-asian-women-hammer-attack-2-large-169.jpg\">Study finds anti-Asian hate crimes surging in 2021<img alt=\"GAZA CITY, GAZA - MAY  20: Palestinians inspect damage to buildings in Al-Saftawi street northern Gaza City on May 20, 2021 in Gaza City, Gaza.
