In February, as farmers protested the Modi government's new farming laws,Twitter briefly suspended many accounts at the government's behest, but reinstated them a few hours later after a public outcry. In recent weeks, criticism against the Modi government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has been intensifying on social media, as users post images of bodies lying in morgues and burning in outdoor crematoriums. India on Monday reported 352,991 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to more than 17.3 million cases, according to a CNN tally of figures from the Indian Ministry of Health. This is the fifth day running that India, with a 1.3 billion population, has added over a 300,000 new cases a day â€”the highest number of cases in a single day anywhere in the world, according to a CNN tally of figures from John Hopkins University.The country's death toll also continues to break records, with 2,812 deaths reported on Monday, marking the tenth day in a row of rising figures.","link":"/2021/04/26/tech/twitter-covid-india-modi-facebook/index.html"}
