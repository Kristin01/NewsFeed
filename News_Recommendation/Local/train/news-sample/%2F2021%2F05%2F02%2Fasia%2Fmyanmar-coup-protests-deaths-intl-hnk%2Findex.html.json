{"title":"Eight killed as Myanmar security forces fire on 'spring revolution' protests","time":"Updated 11:43 PM ET, Sun May 2, 2021 ","body":"Myanmar security forces opened fire on some of the biggest protests against military rule in days on Sunday killing eight people, media reported, three months after a coup plunged the country into crisis.The protests, after a spell of dwindling crowds and what appeared to be more restraint by the security forces, were coordinated with demonstrations in Myanmar communities around the world to mark what organizers called \"the global Myanmar spring revolution.\"\"Shake the world with the voice of Myanmar people's unity,\" the organizers said in a statement.Streams of demonstrators, some led by Buddhist monks, made their way through cities and towns across the country, including the commercial hub of Yangon and the second city of Mandalay, where two people were shot and killed, the Mizzima news agency reported.The Irrawaddy news site earlier posted a photograph of a man it said was a security officer in plain clothes taking aim with a rifle in Mandalay.Read MoreThree people were killed in the central town of Wetlet, the Myanmar Now news agency said, and two were killed in different towns in Shan State in the northeast, two media outlets reported. One person was also killed in the northern jade-mining town of Hpakant, the Kachin News Group reported.Reuters could not verify the reports and a spokesman for the ruling junta did not answer calls seeking comment.The protests are only one of the problems the generals have brought on with their February 1 ouster of the elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.Wars with ethnic minority insurgents in remote frontier regions in the north and east have intensified significantly since the coup, displacing tens of thousands of civilians, according to United Nations estimates.In some places civilians with crude weapons have battled security forces, while in central areas military and government facilities that have been secure for generations have been hit by rocket attacks and a wave of small, unexplained blasts.There have been no claims of responsibility for the explosions.<img alt=\"Protesters make the three-finger salute of resistance during an anti-coup demonstration in Yangon, Myanmar, on Tuesday, April 27.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210428093356-01-myanmar-protest-0427-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarProtesters make the three-finger salute of resistance during an anti-coup demonstration in Yangon, Myanmar, on Tuesday, April 27.Hide Caption 1 of 108<img alt=\"Police officers clear a road after demonstrators spread placards in Yangon on Saturday, April 24.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210428093630-01-myanmar-protest-0424-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarPolice officers clear a road after demonstrators spread placards in Yangon on Saturday, April 24.Hide Caption 2 of 108<img alt=\"Protesters run from security forces during an anti-coup demonstration in Yangon on April 12.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210413231812-01-myanmar-unrest-0412-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarProtesters run from security forces during an anti-coup demonstration in Yangon on April 12.Hide Caption 3 of 108<img alt=\"Buses from the Yangon Bus Service are seen burnt on April 12.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210413231916-02-myanmar-unrest-0412-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarBuses from the Yangon Bus Service are seen burnt on April 12.Hide Caption 4 of 108<img alt=\"Police talk as they arrive at the site of a demonstration in Yangon on April 12.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210413232013-03-myanmar-unrest-0412-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarPolice talk as they arrive at the site of a demonstration in Yangon on April 12.Hide Caption 5 of 108<img alt=\"Anti-coup protesters walk through Yangon&amp;#39;s Hlaing township on April 9.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210411214234-01-myanmar-unrest-0409-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarAnti-coup protesters walk through Yangon's Hlaing township on April 9.Hide Caption 6 of 108<img alt=\"An anti-coup protester raises a decorated Easter egg along with the three-fingered salute of resistance during a demonstration in Yangon on April 4.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210404134256-01-myanmar-unrest-210404-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarAn anti-coup protester raises a decorated Easter egg along with the three-fingered salute of resistance during a demonstration in Yangon on April 4.Hide Caption 7 of 108<img alt=\"Protesters hold homemade pipe air guns during a demonstration in Yangon on April 3.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210403223155-lead-version-01a-myanmar-unrest-0403-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarProtesters hold homemade pipe air guns during a demonstration in Yangon on April 3.Hide Caption 8 of 108<img alt=\"Protesters hold improvised weapons in Yangon on April 3.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210403221527-03-myanmar-unrest-0403-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarProtesters hold improvised weapons in Yangon on April 3.Hide Caption 9 of 108<img alt=\"Residents of the Tamwe area of Yangon participate in a candlelight vigil on April 3.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210403222042-04-myanmar-unrest-0403-super-169.jpg\"> Photos: Unrest in MyanmarResidents of the Tamwe area of Yangon participate in a candlelight vigil on April 3.Hide Caption 10 of 108<img alt=\"People take part in a &amp;quot;flower strike&amp;quot;

Reuters is unable to confirm the toll.The military, which ruled for almost 50 years until launching a tentative reform process a decade ago, acknowledged in mid-April the death of 248 protesters, saying they were killed after they initiated violence.The protests and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes have crippled the economy and raised the prospect of 25 million people sliding into poverty, the UN Development Program has warned.The military said it had to seize power because its complaints of fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party were not addressed by an election commission that deemed the vote fair.Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup along with many other members of her party.","link":"/2021/05/02/asia/myanmar-coup-protests-deaths-intl-hnk/index.html"}
