The lowest percentage of GOP interest in a Trump-style policy effort? How Trump treats liberals, but even that mustered a solid 69% support.Read More\n  \n  \n    \n        \n        \n        \n           THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \n          In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics.

As CBS pollster Anthony Salvanto put it: \"It's a personal connection to him we've seen for years.\"The poll also found that 66% said other Republicans being loyal to Trump is important, which brings us to the matter of Liz Cheney. Among those polled, a whopping 80% of those who were familiar with the GOP move to oust Rep. Liz Cheney from House leadership supported it.For all that was made of Cheney's stand against Trump, this is yet another sign that the non-Trump lane within the Republican Party is extremely narrow, if it exists at all. The Point: Bad news for those searching for signs of a non-Trump path within the Republican Party. Right now, the vast majority of GOP members are still very big on the former President -- and not much else.-- Lauren","link":"/2021/05/17/politics/republican-support-for-trump-poll/index.html"}
