This group was found in a panga, a small open boat often used for working off the coast of Mexico or Central America, according to the US Coast Guard. The engine-powered vessels are typically 25 to 45 feet long.The 21 people included 15 men and six women who were Mexican nationals with no legal status to enter the United States, CBP said.
