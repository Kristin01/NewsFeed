Tencent, for example, runs WeChat Pay, the mobile payments platform linked to its ubiquitous flagship messaging app. As of late 2018, the latest publicly available data, WeChat Pay had more than 800 million monthly active users around the world, according to the company.Tencent shares fell 1.6% in Hong Kong on Friday.In its statement, the People's Bank of China said that companies should also \"disconnect improper links between payment services and other financial products, strictly control the expansion of non-bank payment accounts to the public domain, improve transaction transparency, and correct unfair competition.\"Tencent declined to comment on the meeting, while JD.com, Didi and Meituan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<img alt=\"China hits Alibaba with record $2.8 billion fine for behaving like a monopoly\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210410043728-jack-ma-file-restricted-large-169.jpg\">China hits Alibaba with record $2.8 billion fine for behaving like a monopolyIt was the second such meeting in just three weeks for the A-list of China's tech industry, which was summoned by the country's powerful regulators for a dressing down over antitrust behavior just days after Alibaba was hit with a record $2.8 billion fine for acting like a monopoly.The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), along with the Cyberspace Administration and the State Taxation Administration, met with executives from 34 internet companies, including Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance, to urge them to heed the warning from the Alibaba case and to stop anti-competitive and other illegal behaviors, SAMR said in a statement earlier this month.â€” Laura He and CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report.","link":"/2021/04/30/tech/china-tech-crackdown-finance-intl-hnk/index.html"}
