And I thought, 'Great.'\"Minish tried to take shelter behind some shrubs, but they didn't provide any protection, he told KTUU. He fell backwards as the bear approached him and grabbed it's lower jaw to try to keep it from biting him.Read More\"Because if you grab a dog's lower jaw, it can't bite you,\" he told KTUU. \"So I got a hole punched in my hand with its molar, but he couldn't close his mouth. And all he did was scratch my hand with his upper one.\"But the bear shook its head and knocked his hand away.\"When he did that, he lunged, grabbed my head, took the first bite, relaxed, and took the second bite, that was stronger,\" he told KTUU. \"And that's when he cracked all the bones and part of my head.\"The bear let him go and Minish rolled on the ground trying to protect his face and head with his arms until it left, KTUU reported.He used his t-shirt and surveyors vest to try to stop the bleeding from his head, but still had to wipe blood out of his eyes and off his phone to call for help, he told KTUU.Troopers and local Fire and Rescue personnel were able to locate Minish and take him to the Alaska Pipeline Road, according to the dispatch.
