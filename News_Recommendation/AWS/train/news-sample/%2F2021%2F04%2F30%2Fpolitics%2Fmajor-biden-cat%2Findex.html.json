Last month, Major had a biting incident with a Secret Service agent that required the victim be seen by the White House medical unit. And less than three weeks later, CNN reported Major had bitten another White House worker, this time a member of the National Park Service. The new Biden cat will be joining Major, the first shelter dog to live in the White House, and Champ, the Bidens' older dog, who has been with the Biden family for more than 10 years. The Biden pups restored the tradition of presidential pets after a four-year break during the Trump administration, joining the ranks of Socks Clinton, Barney Bush, Macaroni Kennedy and Rebecca Raccoon Coolidge, among many others. Major is not the first rescue pet in the White House. Before Major there was Yuki, a mixed breed pup abandoned by his owner at a gas station in Texas and rescued by President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci. Bill Clinton's family cat, Socks, was also a rescue. The new cat's rescue status was not immediately clear.
