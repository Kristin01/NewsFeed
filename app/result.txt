of those crewed missions will be millions of miles from home with delayed communications. Before they go, scientists want to understand as much as possible about the potential effects of microgravity and radiation on the human body. A big step toward
this goal was the One-Year Mission, when NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko spent 340 days on the International Space Station from March 2015 to March 2016. <img alt=\

explorers spent nearly a year living in the absence of gravity. The data gathered before, during and after their flight contributed greatly to a better understanding of what happens to the human body in space. Both men were tested up to a year after their
mission.A concern that has emerged regarding astronauts is how their eyes change during long-duration spaceflight, lasting six months or more, and potential impacts to their eye health over time. While crew members typically spend four to six months on
the space station, future planned missions lasting a year or longer warrant more investigation, according to researchers. <img alt=\ "Humans have been living on the space station for 20 years\" class=\ "media__image\" src=\

Researchers now refer
to ophthalmologic and neurologic findings in astronauts after long-duration spaceflight as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, also known as SANS.Read MoreA new study focused on ocular changes and issues experienced by Kelly and Kornienko published
Thursday in the journal JAMA Opthalmology.\"After astronauts began flying long-duration spaceflight missions of about 6 months, we started observing changes in the eyes of some astronauts that we had not observed when they flew short about 2-week long
missions on the Space Shuttle,\" said study author Brandon R. Macias, director of the Cardiovascular and Vision Laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, in an email.\"We now have a few astronauts that have flown even longer duration missions
of up to 1 year in space and our preliminary findings suggest that spaceflight mission duration may contribute to worsened ocular structural changes, such as swelling of the optic nerve head tissues.\"<img alt=\

members who spent about six months on the station. Both men experienced multiple structural changes in their eyes. One developed mild optic disc edema.\"Optic disc edema can occur when the nerve fibers that enter the back of the eye swell or when CSF
(Cerebral Spinal fluid) accumulates around the nerve fibers,\" Macias said. \"If the swelling is severe and lasts for a long period of time visual function can be impacted.\"<img alt=\ "Our bodies in space: Zero gravity weighs heavy on your health\" class=\

folds, according to the study. Neither man was identified regarding the changes they experience.\"The retina at the back of the eye is a smooth layer,\" Macias said. \"Choroidal folds develop when this tissue becomes wrinkled and uneven. These folds can
have different patterns depending on the location and severity and have the potential to impair visual function.\"The two men recovered from optic disc edema after spaceflight, but choroidal folds don't always fully recover, he said. These structural
changes haven't resulted in any significant functional changes to their eyes. However, Macias noted that there is no data on either crew member past one year after returning to Earth. <img alt=\

usually aren't aware until after tests make the detections -- and the changes only have been present for weeks or months, resulting in no immediate effects on their overall eye health. \"However, there is a concern that longer spaceflight missions may
contribute to greater ocular structural changes and that the longer duration that these structural changes are present, the greater likelihood that they could cause damage to the retina, and possibly result in changes in their ocular health,\" Macias
said. <img alt=\ "Astronauts experience these key changes in space that could impact their health, new research shows\" class=\ "media__image\" src=\

as long-term health monitoring once they return to Earth. The scientists also want to understand why some crew members experience greater ocular changes than others. Combined, this information could help the research team develop ways of preventing spaceflight-associated
neuro-ocular syndrome from occurring.There are future plans for more one-year missions, which will allow Macias and his team to study how retinal function is altered over time in space. In addition to measuring how their eyes function before, during and
after missions using electroretinography, which measures the electrical response of the eye's light-sensitive rods and cones, the team will also look at how blood flow changes within the retina. Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore

he said. When these kinds of ocular structural changes are seen in patients on Earth, they can cause vision changes. So far, no astronauts have developed these changes. There is a greater concern, however, about what could happen when astronauts go on
longer missions outside of the space station, exposing themselves to a new space environment that includes higher levels of radiation. There is also uncertainty over if extended periods of partial gravity on the moon and Mars could actually help to maintain
eye health. \"Based on our study, development of severe optic disc edema, or development of folds in our central vision could compromise visual function and this would not be correctable with the available glasses,\" Macias said. "}, {"title": "Apollo

back on NASA's decision to hand a $2.9 billion contract to SpaceX to build the vehicle that will land the next astronauts on the moon. The move adds to a years-long battle between rocket companies owned by the world's two richest men: Jeff Bezos, who
founded Blue Origin, and Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX.The dispute centers on NASA's Human Landing System, or HLS, program, which originally aimed to have at least two private-sector companies compete to build the spacecraft that will ferry astronauts
to the lunar surface for the space agency's Artemis moon landing missions. But earlier this month, NASA made the surprise announcement that it would move forward with SpaceX as the sole contractor for the project, citing costs as a primary reason for
the decision.The news was first reported by the New York Times.Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith told The Times in an interview this week that NASA's decision was flawed because it misjudged advantages of Blue Origin's proposal and downplayed technical challenges
in SpaceX's.Musk responded on Twitter:Read MoreCan't get it up (to orbit) lol\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 26, 2021\\n\\n\"Can't get it up (to orbit),\" he wrote. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk followed up his tweet with
another referring to Blue Origin's proposed lunar lander design, which was called \"Blue Moon,\" as \"Blue Balls.\"Along with Blue Origin, a third company that was competing for the HLS contracts, Alabama-based Dynetics, also protested NASA's decision.Both
Blue Origin and Dynetics argued in their complaints, filed with the Government Accountability Office this week, that NASA hadn't properly evaluated their bids, pressing the space agency to reconsider. The government has 100 days \u2014 or until August
4, 2021 \u2014 to rule on whether the protests have merit.Pushback against such contracting decisions is common, especially in the aerospace industry, where NASA and the US military are the primary customers for rocket builders and winning or losing awards

    of flavors -- including pineapple, mango, lemon, calamansi and its newest Filipino flavor, Coco Plus Buko Pandan. Tang is also one of the most popular drinks during Ramadan in the Middle East, according to Mondelez International, the food corporation

    and community picnic since the 1960s, and its retro charm endures. The sweet throwback is one of those no-bake recipes familiar to anyone who grew up reading recipes off the back of a box.The formula here is simple: Beat together Tang mix, cream cheese,
    condensed milk and whipped topping until fluffy, then chill in a graham cracker crust. Spoon on even more whipped topping to take it over the top.Make a semi-homemade Creamsicle pie this summer for a refreshing treat \u2014 vintage apron optional.Frothy

    food court with just a sip; better grab a hot pretzel for the full effect. Want to make this drink into a cocktail? Just blend in 2 tablespoons white rum or orange-flavored vodka per serving.Takeout-style orange chickenBelieve it or not, a Tang-boosted
    version of chicken in orange sauce is one of the official recipes promoted by Tang Pakistan. The addition of the fruity drink actually makes sense for this sauce, enhancing the sweet and sticky aspects that make the dish a Chinese American classic.When

    and lemon ice creamNo ice cream maker? No problem! This recipe for lemon and orange Tang ice cream uses a simplified method called semifreddo, Italian for \"half-cold.\" By making an easy egg-free custard, then partially freezing, blending, then freezing
    again, the ice cream results in a soft and mousselike texture.If you love the flavor of orange sherbet but the consistency of soft-serve custard, this might be your ideal dessert.Friendship teaProbably the most well-known Tang recipe, this hot beverage
    is another one of those community cookbook staples. It's also frequently referred to as Russian tea, but it bears little resemblance to the strong tea served with lemon and sugar that was the drink's original inspiration.Instead, this citrusy sweet
    tea mix has become an American standard. The proportions change from recipe to recipe, but standard ingredients include instant tea powder, lemonade powder, Tang, and frequently cinnamon, cloves and/or nutmeg for extra spice.Make a jar of homemade

Elon Musk wants to do it anywayBut Musk has frequently talked about the inevitable dangers of his plans for Mars travel, saying at a virtual conference in August that there's a \"good
    chance you'll die\" on an early SpaceX mission to Mars. Such risk predictions track with historical human spaceflight initiatives: Three astronauts died in a fire during ground tests during NASA's Apollo program last century, and 14 other astronauts
    were killed during the Space Shuttle era in the Columbia and Challenger disasters. Read MoreMusk has previously said he hopes to one day live on Mars but has not indicated he would be part of any early settlement missions.He acknowledged, however,
    that assembling the crews for the first Mars missions will be \"like that ad for Shackleton going to the Antarctic,\" referring to a newspaper ad that British explorer Ernest Shackleton supposedly placed in a newspaper at the turn of the 19th Century
    when he sought to assemble a crew for the first-ever excursion to the Antarctic. \"Men wanted for hazardous jouney, small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful, honor and recognition in case of
    success,\" the purported advertisement, to which Shackleton is said to have received more than 5,000 replies, read. But historians have questioned the legitimacy of the advertisement and its surrounding lore.SpaceX's plans for a Mars settlement bring
    up numerous technological, political and ethical questions. One of the most challenging hurdles may also be financial, and SpaceX is likely still many, many years from developing all the technology such a settlement would require.The planet is also
    an exceedingly lethal place to visit: Humans could be killed by radiation exposure, and the planet's surface is so low in atmospheric pressure that a person's blood would literally boil if they were exposed to the elements. That means settlers would
    permanently need to live in air-tight habitats or clunky spacesuits to keep them alive. NASA and others have been researching possible Mars habitats and survival methods for decades, but there is no clearly defined path forward as of yet.Still, Musk
    said SpaceX is aggressively moving forward with its plans to develop the necessary rocket technology, because he believes that establishing a human settlement on Mars will be crucial for our species' long-term survival. Last year, he also proposed
    an aggressive timeline of getting the first crew to the surface by 2026. Should Earth become uninhabitable due to natural or man-made disasters, he says, having a back-up planet will be humanity's best chance. "}, {"title": "5 surprising things about

(CNN)There is a lot to love about
    bees. They are crucial to growing many of our favorite and healthiest foods as they move pollen from plant to plant, pollinating more than a hundred fruits and vegetables including strawberries, potatoes and apples. Unfortunately, many bee species
    are under threat as a result of changes in land use, pesticides, intensive agriculture and climate change -- but there are steps you can take to help them thrive.In honor of World Bee Day on May 20, here are five surprising things you might not know
    about nature's hardest working pollinators.<img alt=\ "A bee pollinates a flower in Nova Friburgo, Rio De Janiero State, Brazil. \" class=\ "media__image\" src=\

Bees like to 'waggle dance'Read MoreBees can communicate and make decisions by dancing. <img alt=\ "Those emerging cicadas are giving some people anxiety\" class=\
    "media__image\" src=\ "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210511175409-cicada-brood-x-anxiety-wellness-restricted-large-169.jpg\">Those emerging cicadas are giving some people anxietyWhen a honeybee scouts out and inspects a new nest it uses a waggle dance to advertise
    and debate its merits. The better the site, the longer and harder the bee dances. If another bee bumps into a dancing bee, she will go off to inspect the site and if she likes it, she, too, will waggle. Eventually, the dynamics of the waggle dancing
    causes about 20 to 30 bees to agree on the best nest site, and they communicate their decision to the rest of the swarm by making high-pitched sounds and by buzzing their wings among the other bees.2. Bees can use toolsHoneybees in Vietnam and other
    parts of Asia are threatened by predatory species of giant hornet that attack bee colonies, killing the adults defending the nest and preying on the young bees. In particular, the voracious hornet species Vespa soror is capable of obliterating the
    hive within hours. <img alt=\ "Wasps have a bad rap. This summer, let&amp;#39;s learn to love them\" class=\ "media__image\" src=\ "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210430212736-01-wasps-pest-control-scn-large-169.jpg\">Wasps have a bad rap. This
    summer, let's learn to love themTo ward off such attacks, the bees have been observed collecting fresh animal feces and smearing it around the entrance to their hive. The researchers, who published their findings last year, call it \"fecal spotting.\"
    The study team believe the poop repels the predatory hornets (which are similar to murder hornets) from the nest by reducing time hornets spend attempting to breach the nest. \"Fecal spotting stands out as extraordinary for several reasons. It marks
    the first report of honey bees of any species foraging for materials that are not derived from plants or water-based fluids. It is also the first clear-cut example of honey bees using a tool in nature,\" the study said.3. Bee poop nearly caused a
    Cold War confrontationIn the 1980s, \"yellow rain\" -- tiny splotches of yellow found on jungle foliage in Laos and Cambodia -- were thought to be the residue of chemical weapons. Refugees said that the yellow rain caused illness and death. The allegations
    prompted the United States to accuse what was then the Soviet Union and its allies of chemical warfare. Bee experts later found that the yellow dots were excretions by massive swarms of wild honeybees.4. Bumblebees get hangryPlants produce dazzling
    flowers laden with nectar to attract pollinators but what's an impatient, hungry bumblebee to do when those flowers haven't yet bloomed? <img alt=\ "Mysterious, new tarantula-like spider identified in the Florida Everglades\" class=\
    "media__image\" src=\ "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210503134953-pine-rockland-trapdoor-spider-trnd-large-169.jpg\">Mysterious, new tarantula-like spider identified in the Florida EvergladesWhen pollen is scarce, bumblebees damaged tomato and mustard plant
    leaves in a unique way that resulted in the plant flowering up to 30 days earlier than unnibbled plants, scientists in Switzerland and France found. For bees, the pollen is a protein source they need to raise their young. However, warmer temperatures
    as a result of the climate crisis means that bees are waking up earlier after hibernating for the winter to find the flowers they need for food haven't yet bloomed. Flowering time, which relies on exposure to light, is less affected by climate change.
    This creates a mismatch that can leaves bees short of food early in spring. <img alt=\ "Bees are seen on a honeycomb cell  at the Urban Bee Hive rooftop site in Woolloomooloo on May 14, 2021, in Sydney, Australia. \" class=\ "media__image\" src=\

Humans have been exploiting honeybees for thousands of yearsA cave painting in Spain thought to be 8,000 years old depicts

    description of cancer is from an ancient Egyptian papyrus, and going back further, even dinosaurs suffered a form of the disease. But cancer long has been thought to have become a common disease only in the last two centuries or so.This is, in part,
    down to longer life expectancies, habits like smoking, and exposure to tumor-inducing chemicals post-industrial revolution.However, new research published in the journal Cancer on medieval skeletons has suggested that cancer was more widespread than
    previously realized -- although still less common than today. In the first study of its kind, researchers from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom analyzed 143 skeletons from six cemeteries from the Cambridge area that were dated to
    between the sixth and 16th centuries. To detect malignant lesions, the team focused on three areas most likely to contain secondary malignant growth in people with cancer -- the spinal column, pelvis and thigh bone. <img alt=\

    found that 3.5% of the individuals showed evidence of metastatic cancer -- that is, when the malignant tumor spreads to a different part of the body from where it started. Read More\"The majority of cancers form in soft tissue organs long since degraded
    in medieval remains. Only some cancer spreads to bone, and of these only a few are visible on its surface, so we searched within the bone for signs of malignancy,\" said Piers Mitchell, a senior research associate and director of the Ancient Parasites
    Laboratory at the University of Cambridge's department of archaeology, in a news statement.Taking into account data on modern populations that shows CT scans detect bone metastases around 75% of the time and the proportion of cancer deaths that involve
    spread to the bone, the researchers estimated that 9% to 14% of medieval Britons developed cancer. \"Modern research shows a third to a half of people with soft tissue cancers will find the tumor spreads to their bones. We combined this data with
    evidence of bone metastasis from our study to estimate cancer rates for medieval Britain,\" explained Mitchell, the study's lead author.<img alt=\

    have had on the risk of developing cancer. \"The best way we have to answer this question would be to study data from before the Industrial Revolution of the 1700s and 1800s and before tobacco became available in Britain following the transatlantic
    settlement of the Americas by Europeans in the 1500s,\" the study said.Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. The researchers said the study
    did have limitations. Diagnosing cancer in those lain dead for many centuries is challenging -- skeletons can't describe their symptoms or have blood tests. Plus, other diseases during life can cause changes in bones that may mimic the lesions made
    by metastases, and decomposition can also affect the bone after death. Also, the sample size was limited by the number of available skeletons with good preservation of the spine, pelvis and thigh bone, which leads to a larger margin of error. \"We
    need further studies using CT scanning of apparently normal skeletons in different regions and time periods to see how common cancer was in key civilizations of the past,\" Mitchell said."}, {"title": "This startup grows kelp then sinks it to pull

    element out of the atmosphere and slow global warming.One Maine-based startup, Running Tide Technologies, is experimenting with farming kelp, a type of seaweed, in an effort to pull carbon from the air and store it deep beneath the ocean floor,\u00a0potentially
    giving the world another nature-based tool to curb climate change.Running Tide Founder Marty Odlin, a Dartmouth graduate and engineer whose family includes generations of fishermen, is working with a team of engineers, software developers, oceanographers,
    maritime professionals, data scientists and hatchery technicians to bury massive amounts of kelp at the bottom of the ocean. Odlin is aiming to \"restore and then accelerate that natural process\" of seaweed soaking up carbon from the atmosphere,
    he told CNN Business.<img alt=\ "The Running Tides Technology boat\" class=\ "media__image\" src=\ "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210430093620-kelp-07-large-169.jpg\">The Running Tides Technology boat\"Kelp is one of the fastest growing things
    in the world, so it pulls carbon in at the fastest rate of any species in the world,\" Odlin said. From his uncle's re-purposed lobster boat, he and his team use ocean currents to move the kelp to deep water where it can be sunk. Gravity then puts
    the kelp under tremendous pressure as it sinks to the deep ocean. The seeds are grown in a hatchery, and once matured, the team puts the kelp into biodegradable buoys. As it grows, the plant eventually becomes too heavy for the buoy and sinks to the
    bottom of the ocean where the massive water pressure pushes it into the sea floor. \"After the kelp grows, the biodegradable buoy will dissolve and lose its buoyancy and everything will sink to the ocean bottom,\" Oldin told CNN. \"The ocean is a
    tremendous natural carbon sink,\" he added.Read MoreBut this is no simple task, he acknowledges. \"The intentional removal of eight hundred gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere will probably be the biggest engineering challenge in human history,\"
    Odlin said. \"It's essentially running 150 years of the oil industry in reverse in 15 years.\"<img alt=\ "Some of the kelp that Running Tide Technology is growing\" class=\ "media__image\" src=\

    environments it sinks to have really low temperatures which can limit decomposition back to carbon dioxide,\" Peter Raymond, a professor of ecosystem ecology at Yale, told CNN Business.Carbon sequestration has been a hot topic for some time, but the
    conversations surrounding the methodologies have picked up as the Biden administration focuses on combating climate change and developing clean energy technologies.\"There are a lot of really progressive companies out there that want to minimize their
    carbon footprint and we can sell the carbon removal service to those companies,\" Odlin said of Running Tide's overarching business strategy. When a company buys a carbon removal credit from Running Tide, Odlin and his team remove the carbon for them

    expensive equipment or energy-intensive processes, and yet their solution has huge potential for combating climate change.\" Shopify is also helping Running Tide scale and commercialize their technology and create more partnership opportunities.While
    planting trees can be one of the best ways to capture carbon, companies are trying to find new ways to step up to the plate now. \"We can do large-scale afforestation efforts, but they're not going to get us to where we need to go,\" Odlin said of
    using trees for carbon sequestration. \"They're not removing carbon from the carbon cycle,\" he added. \"It's kind of like temporary storage.\" Plus, external factors such as wildfires and pine beetle infestations can completely destroy trees, eliminating
    the sequestration and releasing the carbon back into the atmosphere.\"Making it cheaper for businesses to invest in carbon capture and storage is the best way to immediately reduce fossil fuel emissions,\" said Sally Benson, co-director of Stanford
    Energy's Precourt Institute.The timing is urgent. \"This is like an incredibly important crisis, and every year matters,\" Odlin said. \"Every year we allow this carbon in the atmosphere, the world warms up.\""}]}
